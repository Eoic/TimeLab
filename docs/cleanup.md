# TimeLab Codebase Cleanup

This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the TimeLab project codebase.

## Files Removed

### Temporary Debug Scripts

- `debug-dropdown.mjs` - Puppeteer script for dropdown positioning debugging
- `debug-css.mjs` - Puppeteer script for CSS analysis
- `test-dropdown.mjs` - Test script for dropdown functionality
- `test-dropdown.js` - Alternative test script for dropdown
- `test-app-clean.mjs` - Application testing script

### Completed Task Documentation

- `TESTING-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of completed testing implementation
- `FIX-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of label reload bug fixes
- `PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TODO.md` - Completed project management feature TODO
- `CYPRESS-SETUP.md` - Cypress testing setup documentation
- `CYPRESS-RUN-GUIDE.md` - Cypress testing run guide

## Code Changes

### TODOs Removed and Implemented

1. **Label Service Persistence**: Replaced TODO comments with proper `saveTimeSeriesLabel` and `deleteTimeSeriesLabel` calls
2. **Project Storage**: Converted TODO about project-scoped data deletion into proper documentation
3. **Label Modal**: Removed TODO about duplicate name checking (not currently needed)

### Commented Code Removed

1. **Labels Panel**: Removed commented out zoom functionality code
2. **Empty States**: Removed test helper functions exposed on window object

### Comments Cleaned Up

1. **Dropdown Component**: Fixed malformed comment in positioning logic
2. **Inline Comments**: Kept meaningful architectural comments, removed trivial ones

## Code Quality Improvements

- Removed temporary testing code from production build
- Eliminated completed documentation files to reduce repository noise
- Converted TODOs into either implemented functionality or proper documentation
- Maintained meaningful comments that explain build configuration and architectural decisions

## Preserved Elements

- Legitimate test files in `tests/` directory
- SCSS build configuration comments explaining token auto-import
- Architectural comments explaining component design decisions
- Documentation in the `docs/` directory for ongoing reference
